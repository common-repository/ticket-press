Easy to use & customize Customer Support System in WordPress! You are just a one click away to embed this system

== Description ==
This plugin adds to WordPress the features of a complete ticket system. This allows users to submit tickets to report problems or get support on whatever they want. This plugin is so light that it will give a negligible weight for the site.

The plugin works based on two shortcodes:

[my_tickets] -> For listing all tickets
[new_ticket] -> For opening new ticket

This plugin, after the installation does every setup, including creating of two pages for my tickets and new tickets in the site. Along with this, you will be presented with ready-made styling for the form. 
So, with this feature, you can easily startup a support system, just by activating the plugin.

Note: By default the scope isn't created. You need to create one from Tickets > Scope Menu


== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire plugin's ZIP to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory (Extract it, if not extracted).
2. Activate the plugin.

Or

1. Go to Network admin > Plugins > Add New  and upload the zip file of the plugin
2. Activate the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How this plugin works? =
This plugin simply creates a customized template in your page. You just need to install the plugin, and the plugin does everything for you.

= This plugin creates a default page: My tickets & New ticket. Can I create my own page? =
Absolutely yes - You create the page, and paste [my-tickets] and [new-ticket] in tickets listing page and open ticket page, and update it in ticketpress settings page.

= What if I want to customize the template without working on Plugin file? =
We have created a template keeping in mind of template customization. For this, you need to copy template folder from the plugin to your current theme, and rename it to ticketpress. So your directory would look similar to this:
Themes > Current Theme > ticketpress -> [files in plugins template folder]

= I setup the plugin successfully, but when I try to browse the ticket, it do not show right post. Am I missing something? =
Sometime there might be problem with the permalink. So, you need to reset the permalink.
